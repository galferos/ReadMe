Hi, my name is Geordan Alferos
In school, I am interested in renewable energy and sustainabilty. Out of school, I play video games and go to the gym. 
I am currently learning some French History for my writing intensive class as well as coding for this class.  
I am born and raised here In Hawaii on the island of Oahu. 
I am a 5th year here at UH Manoa with a senior standing majoring in Electrical Engineering. 
I chose my major because at the time it seemed more interesting than the other engineering majors Manoa was offering. 
A fun fact about me is my name I guess. There are not a lot of Jordans spelt with a G. 
I want to try to understand coding better. At the time of taking EE 160, I just wanted to pass the class but as an EE major, coding never leaves no matter the track.
A movie I would recommend is "Perks of Being a Wallflower".
